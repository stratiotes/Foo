# Foo
Anthem Test project

The first version is the original code with the bugs and all.

The second version is just some bare essential changes to achieve the desired
outputs along with a simple junit test to automate checking that output.  
One of the main problems with the original was that it used float and double
types for money.  I debated using one of the newer money-oriented utility
packages but decided the most direct conversion would be to just go with 
the BigDecimal approach to keep the changes to a minimum.  Made a few other
minor changes just to make it a little more readable toward the last version
still to be done.
